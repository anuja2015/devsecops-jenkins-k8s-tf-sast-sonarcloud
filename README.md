## SonarCloud and SonarQube

SonarCloud and SonarQube are two products from SonarSource that help developers find and fix issues in their code, such as bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, duplications, and more.

__SonarCloud__

- Cloud based service that integrates with cloud platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, GitLab, and Jenkins.

- Keeps our source code free from code quality issues and code security issues.

- SonarCloud is free for open source projects and has a usage-based pricing model for private projects.

Benefits: 

  **i.** Quality gates : We can define quality criteria for our code based on metrics like bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, coverage, duplications, etc.

  **ii.** Secure code: We can detect and fix security issues in our code before they become exploitable by attackers.

  **iii.** Clean code: We can improve the readability, maintainability, and testability of our code by following best practices and coding standards.

__SonarQube__

- self-managed solution that you can install on your own servers or in a self-managed cloud environment.

- SonarQube offers a free open source version and a yearly subscription for the enterprise version, which includes additional features like branch analysis, portfolio management, security reports, and more.

#### When to use SonarQube and SonarCloud

1. **Code hosting platform**

Cloud platform - SonarCloud is the easiest option

On-premise platform - SonarQube

2. **security and compliance requirements**

If you need to have full control over your data and meet specific security and compliance standards -  SonarQube gives you more flexibility and customization options.

If you are comfortable with trusting a third-party provider with your data and rely on their security measures - SonarCloud can save you time and resources.

3. **budget and resources**

Limited budget or resources to maintain your own servers or databases - SonarCloud can be a cost-effective.
Enough budget and resources to invest in your own infrastructure and support - SonarQube can give you more stability and performance.

## Create an account with SonarCloud

![sonarcloud]("https://sonarcloud.io/login")

Login using GitHub account.

## Integrate SonarCloud with Jenkins Pipeline

1. SonarCloud needs a few inputs.

    i.  projectKey
    ii. organization
    iii. hosturl
    iv.  logintoken
We get all these from sonarcloud dashboard.

SonarCloud Dashboard -> + -> Create new organization -> create manually -> Enter the details -> Select Free Plan -> Create

![organization](Picture1.png)

SonarCloud Dashboard -> + -> Analyze new project -> Create new project -> set up.

SonarCloud Dashboard -> Profile icon -> Account -> Security -> Generatetoken

![generatetoken](Picture2.png)

2. Create Jenkins Pipeline Job

![Job](Picture4.png)

3. Configure the Job

![configure](Picture5.png)

![configure1](Picture6.png)

4. Edit Jenkinsfile and commit

EasyBuggy Vulnerable Web App Modified by A Security Guru :baby_symbol:
=

EasyBuggy is a broken web application in order to understand behavior of bugs and vulnerabilities, for example, [memory leak, deadlock, JVM crash, SQL injection and so on](https://github.com/k-tamura/easybuggy#clock4-easybuggy-can-reproduce).

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/k-tamura/easybuggy/images/mov_eb.gif)

:clock4: Quick Start
-

    $ mvn clean install

( or ``` java -jar easybuggy.jar ``` or deploy ROOT.war on your servlet container with [the JVM options](https://github.com/k-tamura/easybuggy/blob/master/pom.xml#L204). )

Access to

    http://localhost:8080

:clock4: Quick Start(Docker)
-

    $ docker build . -t easybuggy:local # Build container image
    $ docker run -p 8080:8080 easybuggy:local # Start easybuggy

Access to

    http://localhost:8080

### To stop:

  Use <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> ( or access to: http://localhost:8080/exit )
